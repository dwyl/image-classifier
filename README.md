# Why? ü§∑

Building our 
[app](https://github.com/dwyl/app),
we consider `images` an _essential_ 
medium of communication.

By adding a way of classifying images,
we make it *easy* for people
to suggest meta tags to describe images
so they become **searchable**.


# What? üí≠

This run-through will create a simple
`Phoenix` web application
that will allow you to choose/drag an image
and classify the image.


# Who? üë§

This tutorial is aimed at `Phoenix` beginners 
that want to grasp how to do image classifying
within a `Phoenix` application.

If you are completely new to `Phoenix` and `LiveView`,
we recommend you follow the **`LiveView` _Counter_ Tutorial**:
[dwyl/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial)


# How? üíª

In this chapter, we'll go over the development process
of this small application.
You'll learn how to do this *yourself*,
so grab some coffee and let's get cracking!


## Prerequisites 

This tutorial requires you have `Elixir` and `Phoenix` installed.
If you you don't, please see 
[how to install Elixir](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#installation)
and 
[Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#phoenix).

We assume you know the basics of `Phoenix` 
and have *some* knowledge of how it works.
If you don't, 
we *highly suggest* you follow our other tutorials first.
e.g: 
[github.com/dwyl/**phoenix-chat-example**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example)

In addition to this,
**_some_ knowledge of `AWS`** - 
what it is, what an `S3` bucket is/does -
**is assumed**. 

> **Note**: if you have questions or get stuck,
> please open an issue!

## 0. Creating a fresh `Phoenix` project

Let's create a fresh `Phoenix` project.
Run the following command in a given folder:

```sh
mix phx.new . --app app --no-dashboard --no-ecto  --no-gettext --no-mailer 
```

We're running [`mix phx.new`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.New.html)
to generate a new project without a dashboard
and mailer (email) service,
since we don't need those in our project.

After this,
if you run `mix phx.server` to run your server,
you should be able to see the following page.

</p>

We're ready to start implementing!
