    "\n",
    "Among the ensemble of evaluation metrics, the `ROUGE Score` is prominent. Standing for [\"Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)), the ROUGE Score is the lynchpin of automatic text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ROUGE Score` has three main components: **`ROUGE-N`**, **`ROUGE-L`**, and **`ROUGE-S`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each ROUGE score component offers a different perspective on the quality of the system-generated summary, considering different aspects of language and sentence structure. This is why a combination of these measures is usually used in evaluating system outputs in NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROUGE-N\n",
    "`ROUGE-N` is a component of the ROUGE score that quantifies the overlap of [N-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) (contiguous sequences of N items - typically words or characters) between the system-generated summary and the reference summary. It provides insights into the [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) of the system's output by considering the matching N-gram sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ROUGE-N` essentially refers to the overlap of`n-grams`. It consists of `ROUGE-1` (overlap of **unigrams** - each word - between the system and reference summaries) and `ROUGE-2` (refers to the overlap of **bigrams** between the system and reference summaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROUGE-L \n",
    "`ROUGE-L`, another component of the `ROUGE Score`, calculates the [Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence) between the system and reference summaries. Unlike N-grams, LCS measures the maximum sequence of words (not necessarily contiguous) that appear in both summaries. It offers a more flexible similarity measure and helps capture shared information beyond strict word-for-word matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROUGE-S\n",
    "`ROUGE-S` focuses on [skip-bigrams](https://towardsdatascience.com/skip-gram-nlp-context-words-prediction-algorithm-5bbf34f84e0c). A skip-bigram is a pair of words in a sentence that allows for gaps or words in between. This component identifies the skip-bigram overlap between the system and reference summaries, enabling the assessment of sentence-level structure similarity. It can capture paraphrasing relationships between sentences and provide insights into the system's ability to convey information with flexible word ordering.\n",

    "\n",
    "The BLEU score ranges from 0 to 100:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` indicates a complete lack of overlap between the candidate translation (in your case, the predicted caption) and the reference translations (the original captions), which implies very poor quality.\n",
    "- `100` indicates a perfect match with the reference translations, signifying an ideal result.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In practice, you'll rarely see a `BLEU` score of `100`, especially in tasks other than translation, because it would require the candidate text to match the reference exactly, including word choice and order. \n",
    "Even human translators don't often achieve a perfect score because there are many possible ways to correctly translate or summarize a text!\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreting `BLEU` scores, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher scores are better**, as they indicate more `n-gram` overlap with the reference text and, by extension, better quality text generation.\n",
    "- `BLEU` uses `n-gram precision`, which does not capture semantics or meaning. It only measures how many n-grams (up to a certain size) match between the candidate and the reference texts.\n",
    "- **`BLEU` is sensitive to the length of the text.** Very short or very long texts may produce misleading scores.\n",
    "- `BLEU` includes brevity penalty to penalize overly short generated text, as short candidates can have high precision by just including common n-grams.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a higher BLEU score *suggests better resemblance to the reference text at the surface level* (in terms of the exact words and their order), but it does not necessarily mean that the candidate text is more accurate or appropriate. \n",
